This project uses advanced Machine Learning techniques and statistical analysis to explore the historical data of the Italian Lotto game (over the past 60 years), empirically demonstrating that Lotto numbers are fundamentally random. 
It highlights how predictive strategies offer limited advantage in a game predominantly governed by chance and probability.

I used Python, XGBoost, TensorFlow, SQL Server and Pandas.
